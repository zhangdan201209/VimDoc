ince getitng the vpn to work is always a great exercise of google-fu for me, I've decided to finally put this in my space. Im not sure if this is only a ubuntu bug but the client.ovpn file cannot be directly imported on my computer so heres how I do it:
https://vpn.acquisio.com/ - 
Login with your Active Directory credentials
Once logged in, download your connection profile (was the last link at the bottom of the page) instead of the openvpn connect app
Run in the terminal : 
sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn openvpn
With the connection profile you downloaded follow these instructions (from http://askubuntu.com/questions/450493/openvpn-cant-import-configurations-on-new-14-04-installation). The next steps are to extract the configuration components out of the .ovpn file so with the client.ovpn file opened in a text editor
Create a file called ca.crt - copy the text between <ca> and </ca> from client.ovpn into this file
Create a file called client.crt - copy the text between <cert> and </cert> from client.ovpn into this file
Create a file called client.key - copy the text between <key> and </key> from client.ovpn into this file
Create a file called ta.key - copy the text between <tls-auth> and </tls-auth> from client.ovpn 
Remove all the nodes that were extracted from the file
In client.ovpn, Just before the ## --BEGIN RSA SIGNATURE-- line add the below lines and save
ca ca.crt
cert client.crt
key client.key
tls-auth ta.key
In the network-manager

In VPN Connections => Configure VPN... Click the Add Button
Select "Import a saved VPN Connection" and select the client.ovpn file on your drive.
In the next screen, type in your username and your password (you can also not type your password by selecting the Always Ask option, which is a bit more secure but who cares? (smile) )
On the VPN tab => Advanced => TLS Authentication => Key Direction must be changed to 1.
On the IPv4 Settings => Routes... => Check the "Use this connection only for resources on its network"
Save and now in the vpn connections you should be able to select the new connection.

Then try accessing a office website (JIRA, confluence) and then another website which is not on the network. 
It is also a good idea to make the configuration files that we created only user readable (and not group readable).
